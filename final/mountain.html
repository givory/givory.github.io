			<h2>Mountain Bikes</h2>
			<img src="images/mountain biking image 3.jpg" alt="Mountain Biker">
			<p>Oh the beauty of mountain biking. Flying down a hill over rocks and sticks at a questionable speed with little traction and ability to control the bike. This is the biking style for those who love to take risks while also getting a great cardio workout. These bikes are equiped with big tires and are meant to go anywhere you please. Mountain bikes also come with a simplistic suspension set-up meant to help reduce the bumps you experience when off-roading. Possibly the most difficult version of biking, these terrain crawlers require more endurance and strength then most bikes depening on where you want to go. </p>
			
			<h3>Thinking about riding on a beach? Try a sand bike! </h3>
			
			<img src="images/sand bike image 1.jpg" alt="sand Biker">
			
			<p>Sand biking is a very difficult variant of mountain biking. As the name implies, this biking style has you riding on a loose surface like sand. This type of mountain biking is perfect for those who want a real challenge. These bikes have even bigger tires to provide as much traction as possible. This makes riding one of these bikes a great workout for someone trying to make the most of their ride. So if you like getting sunburnt and expending a lot of effort for not a lot of distance, then sand biking is for you.</p>
