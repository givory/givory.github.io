				<h2>Hybrid Bikes</h2>
					<img src="images/hybrid bike image 3.jpg">
					<p>For those who like to experience the best of both worlds, there are hybrid bikes. These bikes are ready for multipurpose functionality, whether it's on or off road. If you want a practical bike that isn't so heavily tailored for one purpose that it struggles doing anything else, then this is your bike. With a light frame and adjustable suspension, they are ready to hit any road. They do many things respectably, not specializing in any particular area. So if you want something that can change its specification quickly, then this is your bike</p>
			
				<h3>Notice</h3>
					<p>While these bikes can multitask effectively, they are not meant for extreme off or on roading. You will not win an on road race with a bike like this just like you won't be able to tackle extreme off road conditions. These bikes are only meant to generalize, not specialize. Attempting to push these bikes could cause injury and damage to the bike. So if you like mountain biking without any traction or control than, as stated before, do not follow these guidelines (we again did not tell you this).</p>
