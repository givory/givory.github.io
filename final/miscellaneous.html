				<h2>Beach Bikes</h2>
				<img src="images/beach bike image 3.jpg">
					<p>When one thinks of a bicycle, a beach bike is possibly the first thing that comes to mind. These heavy and bulky bikes earn their name from the place they are most often used, the beach. A nice cruise down the board walk or an evening ride along the beach. With a very basic setup, these bikes are meant for flat surfaces at slow speeds. Trying to push any limits on this type of bike will end poorly as they are quite heavy. If you live by the beach and just want a bike to mess around with then the beach bike just might be the bike for you.</p>
		
				<h2>Tri-cycle</h2>
				<img src="images/tri cycle image 1.jpg">
					<p>The classic three wheelers. Many children have grown up with this type of bike and have made many memories with this outlier. Mainly a bike meant for children, this bike is an excellent choice for new riders. With no balancing required, this bike is as kid friendly as it gets. It's low stance to the ground means falling off won't result in any serious injuries. This is as kid friendly that can help your child get into the world of bikes.
		
				<h2>Kids Bikes</h2>
				<img src="images/kids bike image 1.jpg">
					<p>Kids seem to have everything these days. Kids also had bikes before that phrase was invented. As one could imagine, a kid’s bike is meant for young kids who are just getting into biking. They are very simplistic and easy to use, focusing more on developing the child's sense of balance. These bikes come with training wheels normally to allow children to learn the ropes without the risk of falling over. If you have a child that wants to get into biking, then this is possibly the best way to introduce them to biking.</p>
		
		
				<h2>Training Wheels</h2>
				<img src="images/training wheels image 1.jpg">
					<p>While this is not a bike, it is an addition that can help a child learn to ride a bike without face planting to an unhealthy extent. These additions allow children to ride a normal bike without the worry of falling over. By adding two extra wheels, the bike can remained balanced without any effort.</p>
		
				<h3>Notice</h3>
					<p>Adults should not attempt to ride a tri-cycle meant for children. Doing so will not only make them look ridiculous but also put them at risk for injury.</p>
					<p>Bikes with training wheels should not be pushed. These are intended for low speeds in order to help children develop a sense of balance on a bike. Going too fast on a bike with training wheels can put you at a great chance for crashing and, as you can guess, many types of injury. Adults should also not use training wheels as they are only meant for small children. Adults who use training wheels can put great stress on them, leading to damage or destruction of the wheel. This occurrence can also lead to injuries.</p>
