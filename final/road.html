				<h2>Road Bikes</h2>
				<img src="images/road bike image 3.jpg">
				<p>If the stereotypical try hard athlete could be transformed into a bike, this is it. Road bikes ride a fine line between eloquent speed machines and sketchy. These are the bikes meant for nothing but asphalt and speed. With a light frame and minimalistic tires, achieving these speeds can be done with ease. If you like racing with bikes, then these are a great choice. They will deliver the best on road performance out of any bike. One thing to consider with these bikes is the integrity of one's back. As stated prior, these bikes are meant for speed. This also means that the riding position is very aggressive and may cause discomfort in the back. Road bikes also do not have the most comfortable seats as compensation for their light weight. If comfort is a must for your bike, then a dedicated road bike is not for you. If comfort is not a problem, then these speedy bikes may be the bikes for you.</p>
			
				<h3>NOTICE</h3>
				<p>These bikes are meant only for smooth and stable road conditions. Riding on a wet surface will put you at a great risk of crashing due to the little traction provided by the tires on these type of bikes. Do not try and ride these bikes off-road. Doing so will result in possible injuries and damage to the bike. These bikes should only be used on a well maintained road in adequate weather conditions. If you like destroying your personal property and getting injured in the process then ignore the following lines (but we didn't tell you that).</p>
